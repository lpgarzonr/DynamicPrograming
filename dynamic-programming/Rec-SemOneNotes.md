Top Down approach

- Solve sub problems when needed On demand
- Use recursion which uses more memory in the call stack

Bottom up approach

- Solve all subproblems first needed to solve the big one
- use for loop
- called table filled
- :) Efficient, less memory bcs no call stack
- in theory harder to implement,
- solve all problems regardless if they are needed or not

Optimization problems
find min, max

take n options and make N layers each one we decide if we take or not a product
